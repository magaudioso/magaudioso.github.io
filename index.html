									<h2>Materials Engineering</h2>
									<p>I recently finished a 12 month co-op at the <a href ="https://nrc.canada.ca/en">National Research Council of Canada</a> in Montreal, QC, Canada. My research was related to the strengthening of viscoelastic elastomers with carbon nanotubes for aerospace applications. I performed mechanical testing and analysis, including tensile, bending, DMA as well as material manufacturing.</p>

									<h2>Data Science</h2>
									<p>Since high school, I have interned at <a href ="https://www.verqu.com/">VerQu, LLC,</a> a data processing, migration, and technology company located in of Raritan, NJ. Working there allowed me to develop a love for data, working in teams, and systems engineering. I have cultivated an interest and a deep appreciation for data science and analytics.</p>

									<h2>Varsity Student-Athlete</h2>
									<p>I have played the game of baseball since the age of 5, with the goal of using baseball to attend a more competitive college. During my first year at McGill, I contributed to the 2018 National Championship team as a catcher, concluding a 5-year run of 5 consecutive national championships for the University. I was twice named <a href ="https://mcgillathletics.ca/news/2019/9/23/baseball-gaudioso-and-downie-landry-named-mcgill-athletes-of-the-week.aspx">McGill Student Athlete of the Week.</a> I also serve as and co-head of the fundraising committee.</p>

							<h2>Projects</h2>
							<p>At VerQu, LLC, my interest in data-driven decisions and systems engineering was born. In my time at VerQu, I worked on a team of engineers and developers delivering on-time migrations and analyses. I have furthered my learning with various Udemy courses, as well as readings such as Think Python: An Introduction to Software Design by Allen B. Downey.</p>

									<h3><a href ="https://github.com/magaudioso/MNIST_Classification">MNIST Dataset Classifier</a></h3>
									<p>The <a href ="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">MNIST dataset</a> is known as the "Hello World" of Machine Learning and forward Neural Networks. I wanted to create a classifier that would accurately predict the correct integer when inputted a 28x28 "handwrititen" image of a written. I wanted to beat the average validation accuracy of 92%, as stated in the TensorFlow documentation. I did that, and obtained 97.74% accuracy for my model.</p>

									<h3><a src ="https://github.com/magaudioso/audiobook_casestudy">Audiobook Classifier</a></h3>
									<p>I found a customer research sample as part of a Data Science Udemy Course I completed. The file is saved under my github as Audiobook.csv. My goal was to classify a customer as "retained" or "not retained" based on a variety of inputs such as money spent, length of book, and other customer features. I was able to build a model to reach 80% accuracy, after sucessfully preprocessing the data.</p>

						<p>This is the stuff that is on my mind. A goal of mine in 2023 is to improve my writing, and this blog is an attempt to do that. Writing about anything and everything is my intent, however, my interest include books I've read/am reading, venture capital, baseball, materials engineering, technology and innovation. </p>
